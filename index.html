                Being born and raised in the city of Chicago as well as working a variety of jobs has had me exposed to many different faces and types of people from all walks of life. Ranging from my first job as a Little League Baseball Umpire, to being a Stage Hand, to being a Receptionist as a school, has given me a very wide range of talents, something I pride myself on. I'm a quick learner and a general, all-purpose individual who can function well-enough in any role, but can still specialize on any given set of skills, particularly when I truly set my mind to it. These are the qualities that I pride myself on within a professional enviornment, as well as hobbies and non- work-releated activities, group or solo.

                  As far as hobbies and interests go, I'm quite all over the place. Recently, I've taken a massive interest in professional motorsport racing. This then split into an interest that is currently my pride and joy- designing paints and liveries on cars in a virtual space that other people use. There is a twist that overlaps with a smaller interests of mine, anime, video game, and graphic design all come together to make what are referred to as "Itasha" race cars. My other interests range from instrumental music of all genres; some very obscure such as "Electro House" or "Liquid Funk" to name a few. Lastly, I have a huge knack for collecting keychains of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to: state keychains, national flags, car brands, video game and anime characters, bands, names, names of bands, historical icons, and much more.
